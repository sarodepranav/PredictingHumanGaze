# PredictingHumanGaze
This is the project we did during Senior year of our Bachelor's Degree (Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering). This Github repository features the code for training the LSTM-based saliency model for predicting human gaze fixations. The dataset used was SALICON - which is a benchmark dataset for saliency prediction projects. For any queries regarding the execution you can contact me on - sarodepranav@gmail.com
