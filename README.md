# Predicting Human Gaze Fixations using LSTM
This is the project we did during Senior year of our Bachelor's Degree (Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering). This Github repository features the code for training the LSTM-based saliency model for predicting human gaze fixations. The dataset used was SALICON - which is a benchmark dataset for saliency prediction projects.
